    printIntro()  
         ↓  
    getDimensions() → (returns length, width)  
         ↓  
    computeAmount(length, width) → (returns amtNeeded)  
         ↓  
    printReport(length, width, amtNeeded)

2a) `randrange(0, 11)`  
2b) `random() * 1.0 - 0.5`  
2c) `randrange(1, 7)`  
2d) `randrange(2, 13)`  
2e) `random() * 20.0 - 10.0`

# **Question 3**  
A designer might choose **spiral development** over a top-down approach when:  
1. **Uncertain or evolving requirements**: The project’s goals or user needs are unclear and likely to change.  
2. **High risk**: The technology, scope, or feasibility involves significant unknowns that need iterative validation.  
3. **Need for flexibility**: Frequent feedback loops and adaptability to changes are critical
4. **Complexity**: The problem is multifaceted, requiring incremental refinement and prototyping to manage technical or design challenges.  
5. **Risk management**: Early identification and mitigation of risks through iterative cycles
