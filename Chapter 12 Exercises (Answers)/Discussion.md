# **Question 1**  
1. Identify objects (nouns) and their responsibilities.
2. Define interactions between objects.
3. Design class interfaces (methods) and state (instance variables).  
4. Assign responsibilities using principles like encapsulation.  
5. Refine iteratively with trial/error.  
6. Optimize for simplicity and flexibility.

# **Question 2**
#### **Encapsulation**  
*Bundling data and methods into a class while restricting direct access to internal state, exposing only whatâ€™s necessary via public methods.* 

#### **Polymorphism**  
*Allowing objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in class-specific ways.* 

#### **Inheritance**  
*Subclass gets methods/data from superclass.*
