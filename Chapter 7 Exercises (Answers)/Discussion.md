# **Question 1**  
**a) Simple Decision**  
A simple decision uses a single `if` statement to execute code based on one condition.  
**Example:**  
```python  
if time == "9pm":  
    go_to_sleep()  
```  

**b) Two-Way Decision**  
A two-way decision uses `if-else` to choose between two mutually exclusive paths.  
**Example:**  
```python  
if road_blocked:  
    take_alternate_route()  
else:  
    continue_on_road()  
```  

**c) Multi-Way Decision**  
A multi-way decision uses `if-elif-else` to handle multiple distinct conditions sequentially.  
**Example:**  
```python  
if coldness == "none":  
    fan.speed = "high"  
elif coldness == "mild":  
    fan.speed = "low"  
else:  
    fan.off()  
```

# **Question 2**  
**Similarity:**  
- Both check for specific conditions to control program flow.  
- **Example:**  
  - `try` checks for runtime errors (e.g., dividing by zero).  
  - `if` checks logical conditions (e.g., user input validation).  

**Difference:**  
- **Exception Handling (`try/except`):**  
  - Catches **runtime errors** (e.g., `ValueError`, `TypeError`).  
  - Requires minimal code to handle multiple potential errors.  

- **Ordinary Decision Structures (`if`):**  
  - Checks **predefined logical conditions** (e.g., user input is a number).  
  - Requires explicit checks for all possible edge cases.
